# Node.js Repository Pattern Project

🚀 A powerful Node.js project implementing the repository pattern for efficient data management.

## Overview

This project aims to provide a scalable and maintainable solution for data management in Node.js applications using the repository pattern. The repository pattern separates the data access logic from the business logic, allowing for cleaner code, easier testing, and increased flexibility.

## Features

✨ **Separation of Concerns**: The repository pattern isolates the data access logic from the rest of the application, making it easier to maintain and test.

📦 **Modular Architecture**: The project follows a modular architecture, allowing you to organize your code into reusable and independent modules.

📝 **CRUD Operations**: Implements Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations, providing a consistent interface to interact with the data.

🔒 **Authentication and Authorization**: Includes a robust authentication and authorization system to secure access to data and resources.

🔍 **Search and Filtering**: Implements search and filtering capabilities to easily retrieve specific data based on custom criteria.

📈 **Pagination and Sorting**: Provides pagination and sorting functionalities to efficiently handle large datasets.

📡 **Database Support**: Compatible with various databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and more.

🔌 **ORM Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with popular Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) libraries for database interactions.

🧪 **Unit Testing**: Includes a comprehensive suite of unit tests to ensure code reliability and prevent regressions.
